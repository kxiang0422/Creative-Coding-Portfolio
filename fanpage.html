  <h3>National Historic Sites</h3>

  <p>Historic site or heritage site is an <strong>official location where pieces of political, military, cultural, or social <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"> history</a> have been preserved due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage"> cultural heritage</a> value. </strong>Historic sites are <u>usually protected by law</u>, and many have been recognized with the official <em>national historic site</em> status. A historic site may be any building, landscape, site or structure that is of local, regional, or national significance. <u>Usually this also means the site must be at last 50 years or older.</u>so I'd like to instroduce you to the top five places of interest National Historic Sites.</p>

  <h5>Top 1 MaChu Picchu</h5>

  <p>Located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru">Southern Peru</a>, this ruined city lies on top of a mountain that’s only accessible by train or a four-day trek. <u>Rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1911, it was an important cultural center for the Inca civilization but was abandoned when the Spanish invaded the region. </u>(It is famously referred to as the <strong>“Lost City of the Incas,”</strong> though that is actually Vilcabamba). The location was made a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, and it was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in 2007. Concerns over growing numbers of tourists have led to limitations on how many people can enter the site, though only by a fraction of what is necessary. Hopefully, they will limit it even more so this site can last for hundreds of years more.</p>

  <h5>Top 2 Tikal</h5>

  <p>This Mayan city-state is one of the largest and best-preserved ruins of that <u>civilization and was a dominant force in the Mayan world during the Classic Period (200-900 AD).</u> Located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, this place lets you experience your inner Indiana Jones early in the morning or late at night when the tourists go home and it’s just you and the jungle. It is very serene, and that made for one of the best travel memories I have. Be sure to spend the night in the park, as you then really get to see it without the crowds. I particularly enjoyed seeing the sunrise from atop the temples.</p>

  <h5>Top 3 The Pyramids at Giza</h5>

  <p>They’re over <strong>3,000 years old</strong>, and we still don’t have a good idea as to how they were built or how the Egyptians made them so precise <u>(were aliens involved?)</u>. The three pyramids align to the stars and the solstices and contain tons of chambers that still haven’t been (and cannot be) opened. I mean, how did they create those little chambers where people can’t even crawl through? The <u>largest one</u>, called the <strong>Great Pyramid</strong>, was built by the <strong>Pharaoh Khufu</strong> and has limited access to it. The Pyramids are truly a marvel of human engineering that was fit for kings. (You will also find the Sphinx nearby, another historical site whose mysteries baffle researchers and are the subject of many conspiracy theories.)</p>

  <h5>Top 4 Angkor Wat</h5>

  <p>This ancient city in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia">Cambodia</a> was the <strong>center</strong
    > of the Khmer Empire that once ruled most of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. This empire fell into decline, but not before building amazing temples and buildings that were later reclaimed by the jungle for hundreds of years.Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat">Angkor Wat</a> is packed with tourists, it’s still breathtaking to see. And the temple regions to the north and south see far fewer tourists than the main temple grouping. (Though admittedly, some of them are simply piles of stone rubble now.)
  <u>The most popular temples are Angkor Wat, Bayon, Ta Phrom, and Angkor Thom, and they always have crowds.</u> In order to really experience the temples, you’ll need to purchase the three- or five-day pass. The best time to visit is early in the morning before the big tour groups arrive and stay late after they have gone.</p>

  <h5>Top 5 Stonehenge</h5>

  <p>Located near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury">Salisbury</a>, this megalithic structure is over <strong>3,000 years old</strong>, and its stones come all the way from Wales. <u>Scholars still are not sure how the builders got the stones there and have tried to replicate the feat, with dismal results.</u> Moreover, we only have a vague idea of its purpose (we’re basically just guessing). Stonehenge is now fenced off, and you can no longer go into the circle; visitors can only walk around the attraction. But it’s worth visiting for the mystery behind it and an excellent and detailed audio tour.</p>
